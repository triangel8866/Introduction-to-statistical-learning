## 8(a)
i. The F statistic is far more than 1 and p-value is close to zero. So there is relationship between response and predictor.
ii. RSE is `4.906` so the percentage error is 4.906/23.45=20.9%. R square is `0.6059` which indicates that 60.59% variance could be explained by response.
iii. The relationship between predictor and response is negative with coefficient `-03157845`.
iv. The predicted `mpg` associated with `horsepower` of 98 is 24.46708. The 95% confidence interval is [23.973,24.961], prediction interval is [14.8094,34.12476].

## (c)
From the first plot, there is evidence of non-linearity.

## 9(c)
i. The F statistic is 232.4 and p-value is close to zero. There is relationship between response and predictors.
ii. weight, year and origin have a statistically significant relationship to the response.
iii. The coefficient of year suggests that with one year increase, the mpg increase by 0.75 with other variables fixed.

## (d)
From the studentized residual plot, there are some large outliers. The leverage plot showes point 14 has unusual high leverage.

## (f)
log(weight) and acceleration^2 are statistically significant in the model. There are some outliners from the residual plot. And leverage points are more than 3 points.
However, the first plot indicates the non-linearity of the model which could be solved by log(Y).


## 10(b)
With one increase on Price, sales will decrease by 54 on average. 
The store is in urban or not does not make difference on sales.
Stores in US have 1201 more sales than stores not in US on average.

## (c)
Sales = 13.04 - 0.0545Price -0.022UrbanYes + 1.2USYes

## (d)
Price and USYes could reject the null hypothesis.

## (f)
The model in (e) is slightly better than model in (a).

## (h)
There is evidence of high leverage obs.

## 11(c)
t statistics are the same.

## 12(a)
When sum of square x equals sum of square y.

## 13(g)
R square and MSE all increase slightly after adding quadratic terms. But the quadratic predictor is not statistically significant.

## (h)
After decreasing the variance of the error term, R square increase and MSE decrease significantly.

## (i)
Unlike (h), after increasing the variance of the error term, R square decrease and MSE increase significantly.


## (j)
The confidence intervals on the noisier data set are wider than the original data set and the ones of original data set are wider than the less noisy data set.

## 14(c)
The coefficients are relatively close to parameters with high standard errors. The coefficient of x1 is statistically significant while the coefficient of x2 is not statistically significant

## (d)
We could reject the null hypothesis with p value close to zero.

## (e)
We could reject the null hypothesis with p value close to zero.

## (f)
The results obtained in (c)-(e) do not contradict with each other. In (d) or (e), we only consider one predictor while in (c), we consider both predictors. Because x1 and x2 have collinearity, the effect of each predictor seperately are significantly but we could not seperate them in (c).

## (g)
The observation makes coefficient of x1 insignificant and coefficient of x2 significant. The observation is the leverage point in model 1 and model 3. It is the outlier in model 2.

## 15(a)
Except chas, all are statistically significant.

## (b)
We could reject the null hypothesis for zn, dis, rad, black, medv.
